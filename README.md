This project is a part of my AI and data science learning journey, completed while pursuing Udacityâ€™s Nanodegree program in "AI Programming with Python."

In the project I have programed:
- a command line application that trains a model with the given dataset.
- another command line application which recognize different species of flowers.

Dataset: I use [this dataset](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/index.html) of 102 flower categories.
