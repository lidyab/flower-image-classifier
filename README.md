This project is part of my AI and Data science learning journey, I worked on this project when I took Udacity's Nanodegree program "AI programing with Python".

In the project I have programed:
- a command line application that trains a model with the given dataset.
- another command line application which recognize different species of flowers.

Dataset: I use [this dataset](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/index.html) of 102 flower categories.
