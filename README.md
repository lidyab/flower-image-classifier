This project is a part of my AI and data science learning journey, completed while pursuing Udacityâ€™s Nanodegree program in "AI Programming with Python."

In this project, I developed:
- A command-line application that trains a model by taking the directory of an image dataset as input.
- Another command-line application that identifies the most probable species of a flower by taking the path of the flower image as input.

Dataset: I use [this dataset](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/index.html) of 102 flower categories.
